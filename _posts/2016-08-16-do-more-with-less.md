### Measure yourself
**If You Can't Measure It, You Can't optimize It**. Use meaningful metrics things like how many tasks you finish in a day or even how many hours you work. So start with profiling your daily activity with profiling I mean things like answering emails, meetings, calls every little thing you make.     

### Mastering your tools
 Your OS, IDE, browser for web development and any supporting tools (database management tool, source control tool, etc ).Best use of these tools can save your times.start with frequent tasks that take you time, so you navigate through code pages take ten seconds and you know shortcut do that in 2 seconds. I have a tip I use for things when working with new tools google for "tips and tricks for X" and by uses this tip it can save you numerous hours.      
### Define term "DONE"
 Done means done simply isn't it, the word "done but x and y" doesn't mean done. So define done means code is tested and has desired business impact define your checklist.
